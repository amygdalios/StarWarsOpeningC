# Star Wars ASCII Player üé•‚ú®

A small C script that will play the entire **Star Wars intro** from the original film using ASCII art in the terminal!

---

## üìú Features
- Plays an ASCII-rendered version of the **Star Wars Intro** in your terminal.
- Includes synchronized audio playback using `ffplay`.
- Fully customizable: use your own video and audio files to recreate the magic.

## üõ†Ô∏è How I Made This
1. **Extracting Frames from Video**:  
   I used `ffmpeg` to extract frames from the original Star Wars intro video:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i starwarsintro.mov -vf fps=10 frames/output_%03d.png
   ```
2. **Converting Frames to ascii art**:
   I made a python script (I know this is cheating since this was originally a C project) to use the `jp2a` tool to convert all frames into ascii art:
   ```python
   os.system(f"jp2a --width=80 --output={output_txt_file} {frame_file}")
   ```
   I also used davinci resolve to remove the background most of the frames since the white scenery of the original intro would mess up with jp2a.
   
4.**Player written in C**:
  The main player is written in C and it displays the ascii art in sequence while playing audio:
  - **Audio Playback**: Using `ffplay` I achieved audio playback along with video.
  - **Frame rendering**: Frames are simply being grabbed from the `frames/` directory and are being printed with a delay in between them.

## üé¨ How to run
1. **Dependances**
   Ensure these tools are installed:
   - `gcc` to compile the program.
   - `ffplay` to play the audio along with frames.
   **For frame conversion**:
     If you want to use the python script to convert your own video to ascii art:
     - `ffmpeg` to convert video to png frames.
     - `jp2a` to convert `ffmpeg` output to ascii art.

2. **Setup**
   Clone this repo and cd into folder
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amygdalios/StarWarsOpeningC.git
   cd StarWarsOpeningC
   ```

3. **Compile and Run!**
   Compile the program using gcc
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o main
   ```
   And finally run the program and enjoy üçø
   ```
   ./main
   ```
